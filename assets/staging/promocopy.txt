**General promo**

Its possible for clients to have a great relation with Agencies or freelancers. and which you go with typically depends on what the needs of your project are.

Benefits of working with a freelancer:
	1. Freelancers generally cost less than agencies
	2. Shorter total project turnaround time
	3. Freelancers typically can respond faster than agencies
	3. You have the benefit of working with someone who knows your everything about your project. And you dont feel like your constantly bounced around contacts as can happen in some agencies.
	4. The job is small enough that it can be handled by 1-3 developers
	5. Communication channels aren't too formal
	6. The project doesnt require large complex contracts, as is often the case with larger corporate projects
	7. You want to have some say in the project - larger agencies often have established processes, so even if you can make contact with people within the agency to request a change, that person may be "locked" into the agencies established system.
	8.
